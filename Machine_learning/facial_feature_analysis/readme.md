## Project overview:

<i> 

### Job Title:
Machine Learning / Computer Vision Expert for Facial Feature Classification (Jaw Size + Beyond)

### Description:
We're building a research-driven facial feature classification system, starting with jaw size detection from images. Our initial dataset includes a few hundred labeled facial images (strong, moderate/average, weak/receding jaws). However, facial pose variation makes standardized measurement across faces challenging.

We are looking for a Machine Learning expert who can not only build the initial model but also help define the optimal technical strategy going forward—including how to expand and auto-label future datasets.

### Challenges & Goals:

Develop a robust jaw-size classification model despite variation in facial angles and poses.
Explore and propose the best modeling approach: CNNs, transfer learning, or alternative techniques (e.g., using MediaPipe facial landmarks as features).
Investigate semi-supervised or active learning methods to help generate labels for new, unlabeled images.
Design the system with scalability in mind—future stages will involve classification of other facial traits.
What You’ll Do:

Analyze our current dataset and define preprocessing standards.
Recommend and implement the best-suited model architecture (CNN, landmark-based model, or hybrid).
Support training, evaluation, and testing pipeline.
Help lay the groundwork for automated data expansion (e.g., self-training, pseudo-labeling).
Advise on lightweight tools for experimentation and possible deployment.
Ideal Experience:

Strong background in computer vision, especially facial analysis.
Experience with CNNs, landmark-based modeling, and tools like MediaPipe, Dlib, or OpenCV.
Familiar with handling small/medium datasets and augmenting them effectively.
Bonus: Experience with semi-supervised learning or few-shot learning.
Ability to collaborate and think strategically in a research environment.
Project Type:
Initial short-term contract, with the goal of ongoing collaboration as we expand to other facial features. Fully remote.

If this sounds interesting, please reach out with your background, relevant projects, and a brief outline of how you might approach the jaw classification challenge. </i>

### Project Proposal
<i> 
Developing a jaw-strength classification model & web application following these steps: 
1. **Face Detection:**
   - **MediaPipe** is a good choice for face detection as it provides robust facial landmark detection. You can use it to crop the face from the image effectively.
2. **Classify Faces into Male, Female:**
   - Using pre-trained models for gender classification, such as those available in libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Fine-tuning these models on your specific dataset can improve accuracy.
3. **Measure Jaw Length Ratio to Face Length:**
   - Using the facial landmarks detected by MediaPipe to calculate the jaw length and face length. You can define specific points on the jawline and face to measure these distances.
4. **Domain Knowledge Table for Jaw Classification:**
   - Develop a table based on domain knowledge or literature that categorizes jaw ratios into strong, moderate/average, or weak/receding. This table should be validated with expert input if possible.
5. Wrapping it all in a Streamlit Web application for testing.

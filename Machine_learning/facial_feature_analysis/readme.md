## Project overview:

### Job Title:
Machine Learning / Computer Vision Expert for Facial Feature Classification (Jaw Size + Beyond)

### Description:
We're building a research-driven facial feature classification system, starting with jaw size detection from images. Our initial dataset includes a few hundred labeled facial images (strong, moderate/average, weak/receding jaws). However, facial pose variation makes standardized measurement across faces challenging.

We are looking for a Machine Learning expert who can not only build the initial model but also help define the optimal technical strategy going forward—including how to expand and auto-label future datasets.

### Challenges & Goals:

Develop a robust jaw-size classification model despite variation in facial angles and poses.
Explore and propose the best modeling approach: CNNs, transfer learning, or alternative techniques (e.g., using MediaPipe facial landmarks as features).
Investigate semi-supervised or active learning methods to help generate labels for new, unlabeled images.
Design the system with scalability in mind—future stages will involve classification of other facial traits.
What You’ll Do:

Analyze our current dataset and define preprocessing standards.
Recommend and implement the best-suited model architecture (CNN, landmark-based model, or hybrid).
Support training, evaluation, and testing pipeline.
Help lay the groundwork for automated data expansion (e.g., self-training, pseudo-labeling).
Advise on lightweight tools for experimentation and possible deployment.
Ideal Experience:

Strong background in computer vision, especially facial analysis.
Experience with CNNs, landmark-based modeling, and tools like MediaPipe, Dlib, or OpenCV.
Familiar with handling small/medium datasets and augmenting them effectively.
Bonus: Experience with semi-supervised learning or few-shot learning.
Ability to collaborate and think strategically in a research environment.
Project Type:
Initial short-term contract, with the goal of ongoing collaboration as we expand to other facial features. Fully remote.

If this sounds interesting, please reach out with your background, relevant projects, and a brief outline of how you might approach the jaw classification challenge. </i>

#  PREDICT AND PROVIDE INSIGHTS ON LOAN APPROVAL DECISIONS

## A step by step [guide](https://github.com/mzaoualim/UpWork_Proposals/blob/main/Machine_learning/loan_approval/notebook.ipynb) to:
* Analyze an approved/denied loan dataset.
* Preprocess and prepare data to inference.
* Build a baseline model for benchmarking.
* Tune hyperparameters for a tree-based model.
* Evaluate the model and save the best version.

## Additionnally, a [Streamlit Web Application](https://loans-approval.streamlit.app/) is provided to allow users to experiment with different inputs. It displays the corresponding SHAP values along with detailed commentary powered by Gemini AI.
